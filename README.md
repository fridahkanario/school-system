# school-system
This is my step by step approach using php to build a simple school system. This application will have a teacher's module and a student's module.
The teacher will have a registration panel, then login in to the system and create subjects that will appear on the students module, where a student can register for a particular subject(s) and later the teacher can view the student and the subjects registered for.
